Another wack of Dzejmod is that the second project file (dzejAddons) has no idea about the default textures in /mat/textures, but it works in-game since stuff from /game gets mounted.

To work around this you need to do the following.

1. Setup your scenes and stuff here.
2. Copy them over to your addon.

NOTE: Do NOT open directly the scenes from the second project file (dzejAddons), because textures will NOT work.

We'll try to find a better way to do this. but for now this is the best way.
Sorry.
